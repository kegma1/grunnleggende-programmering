# Write a function that returns the sum of all the elements in a specified column in a matrix using the following header:
# def sumColumn(m, columnIndex):
# Write a test program that reads a 3 Ã— 4 matrix and displays the sum of each column. Note that the matrix is entered by rows and 
# the numbers in each row are separated by a space in one line.
# Sample Run
# Enter a 3-by-4 matrix row 0: 1.5 2 3 4
# Enter a 3-by-4 matrix row 1: 5.5 6 7 8
# Enter a 3-by-4 matrix row 2: 9.5 1 3 1
# Sum of the elements for column 0 is 16.5
# Sum of the elements for column 1 is 9.0
# Sum of the elements for column 2 is 13.0
# Sum of the elements for column 3 is 13.0
